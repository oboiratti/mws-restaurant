# Restaurant Reviews App
A simple app which shows restaurants and reviews of various people on that restaurant.

## Quick Start

### Run
* To run check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. 
* If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) 
* For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 
* If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
